### 2. Understand and apply concepts of (CIA) confidentiality, integrity and availability  
#### 2.1. CIA Triad explanation:  
As a security professional or a trainee you need to know CIA (Confidentiality, integrity and availability) down to its core.   
We will focus on the three key principles as we will now refer them as CIA triad. In the field of information security, we have assets which can be tangible (something you can touch) for example your organization computers, servers, employees, data etc. and non-tangible (something you cannot touch) for example your reputation, your market share, your share or stock value etc. all of these assets requires security and the first thing as a security practitioner you will do is to utilize the CIA principle to assess what level of security you need to apply as per your business, security and compliance requirements. This is true even for data that is stored in any form, be it electronically or in printed hardcopy. It also applies to any systems, mechanisms, techniques used to process/manipulate/store/transmits that data.
