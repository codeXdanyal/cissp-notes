### 8.1 Understand and integrate security in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
### What it means
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the structured process through which software is conceived, designed, developed, tested, deployed, and maintained. Integrating security into the SDLC ensures that software is not only functional but also resilient against attacks. Addressing security early reduces the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced, decreases remediation costs, and strengthens the overall security posture of the organization. A CISSP professional must 
#understand how to embed security across all SDLC phases, considering both technical and operational requirements.

### Development methodologies (Agile, Waterfall, DevOps, DevSecOps, Scaled Agile Framework)

- **Waterfall:** A sequential, phase-based approach. Security testing usually occurs late in the cycle, making vulnerabilities expensive to fix. Security integration can include dedicated review phases, penetration testing, and formal approval gates.

- **Agile:** Uses iterative sprints to develop software incrementally. Security must be integrated into each sprint, with regular code reviews, automated tests, and threat modeling during planning sessions.

- **DevOps:** Emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams, enabling faster software delivery. Security practices include automated deployment checks, configuration management, and continuous monitoring of environments.

- **DevSecOps:** Extends DevOps by embedding security practices directly into CI/CD pipelines. Security automation includes SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), dependency scanning, and secret detection.

- **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe):** Implements Agile practices at enterprise scale, coordinating multiple teams. Security policies, compliance requirements, and secure coding standards are applied consistently across teams.

**Example:** In a DevSecOps pipeline, a developer’s commit triggers automated static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities. If issues are found, the pipeline blocks deployment until the code is remediated.

#
### Maturity models (CMM, SAMM)

- **Capability Maturity Model (CMM):** Evaluates the maturity of software development processes. Higher maturity levels indicate structured, repeatable, and measurable processes that support secure development.

- **Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM):** Focuses specifically on security practices in software development, including governance, construction, verification, and deployment. SAMM helps organizations benchmark and improve their secure development processes.

**Example:** A company at SAMM Level 1 may perform ad-hoc security testing, whereas Level 3 organizations have automated testing, regular threat modeling, and continuous security training for developers.

#
### Operation and maintenance
Once software is deployed, it must be monitored for security issues, updated regularly, and patched against newly discovered vulnerabilities. This phase also includes auditing logs, performing incident response, and ensuring continuity of operations.

**Example:** A SaaS provider applies monthly patches to its application stack, monitors logs for abnormal behavior, and runs periodic vulnerability scans to detect misconfigurations or unpatched components.

#
### Change management
Changes to software, infrastructure, or operational procedures must follow formal processes to minimize risks. Security validation, impact assessment, and rollback plans are integral to change management.

**Example:** Before deploying a new microservice, the change management process requires a risk assessment, security review, automated regression tests, and approval from both the development and security teams.

#
### Integrated Product Team (IPT)
An IPT is a cross-functional team that includes developers, testers, security specialists, compliance experts, and operations personnel. This collaboration ensures security requirements are considered from concept to deployment, fostering accountability and consistent security practices.

**Example:** A healthcare application’s IPT includes a compliance officer who verifies that HIPAA regulations are embedded in the design, while developers implement secure coding standards and testers validate access controls.

#
### Key takeaway
Integrating security throughout the SDLC ensures vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated early, reducing remediation costs and improving software resilience. Combining mature development methodologies, formal change management, continuous monitoring, and collaborative teams (IPTs) allows organizations to build secure, compliant, and high-quality software. Security is not a final step but a continuous, integral part of every SDLC phase.

#
### 8.2 Identify and apply security controls in software development ecosystems
### What it means
This topic focuses on embedding security controls throughout the software development ecosystem. Every component—from programming languages and libraries to CI/CD pipelines—can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly secured. A CISSP professional must recognize potential risks, select appropriate security controls, and ensure their enforcement across development, build, deployment, and runtime environments.

#
### Programming languages
Different languages have inherent security characteristics and pitfalls. Some languages help prevent common vulnerabilities, while others require careful coding practices.

**Example:** Using Java or C# can reduce risks like buffer overflows compared to C/C++, but developers must still handle input validation and memory management properly.

#
### Libraries
Third-party libraries can introduce vulnerabilities if outdated or malicious. Secure development requires tracking, updating, and validating dependencies.

**Example:** A web application uses an old version of a JavaScript library with a known XSS vulnerability; updating the library mitigates the risk.

#
### Tool sets
Development tools (compilers, build systems, debuggers) must be secure to prevent tampering or accidental introduction of vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Ensuring build tools are downloaded from trusted sources and verifying checksums prevents supply chain attacks.

#
### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
IDEs can support secure coding practices through plugins or features that detect common vulnerabilities, enforce coding standards, and integrate with testing tools.

**Example:** A developer uses an IDE plugin that highlights insecure function calls or potential SQL injection points in real-time.

#
### Runtime
The runtime environment (where code executes) must be secured to prevent exploits like injection attacks, privilege escalation, or untrusted code execution.

**Example:** Enforcing sandboxed execution for scripts reduces the risk of system compromise if malicious code is accidentally executed.

#
### Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
CI/CD pipelines automate building, testing, and deploying software. Security controls must be embedded to detect vulnerabilities, enforce policy, and prevent unsafe code from reaching production.

**Example:** Integrating automated SAST and DAST scans in the pipeline blocks code with critical vulnerabilities from being deployed.

#
### Software configuration management (CM)
CM ensures software artifacts and configurations are tracked, versioned, and protected. This prevents unauthorized changes and supports accountability.

**Example:** Only authorized personnel can commit configuration changes, and all changes are logged and auditable.

#
### Code repositories
Repositories host source code and must be protected with access controls, branch policies, and secure workflows to prevent tampering or leakage.

**Example:** Git repositories enforce branch protection rules, code reviews, and multi-factor authentication for contributors.

#
### Application security testing
Different testing methods validate software security:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Examines source code or binaries for vulnerabilities without execution.

- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Tests running applications for security weaknesses.

- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Identifies vulnerable third-party components.

- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST):** Combines static and dynamic testing during runtime to detect vulnerabilities in real usage contexts.

**Example:** A CI/CD pipeline integrates SAST to catch coding errors, DAST to test web endpoints, and SCA to ensure no vulnerable libraries are deployed.

#
### Key takeaway
Securing a software development ecosystem requires a holistic approach: choosing safe languages, maintaining libraries, enforcing secure tool usage, protecting runtime environments, and integrating continuous security testing. CI/CD, CM, and code repository policies ensure vulnerabilities are detected and mitigated early, reducing risk and improving overall software resilience. Security is embedded throughout development, not applied after deployment.

#
### 8.3 Assess the effectiveness of software security
### What it means
This topic focuses on evaluating how well security measures protect software throughout its lifecycle. Assessment ensures that implemented controls are effective, vulnerabilities are identified, and residual risks are minimized. Regular evaluation allows organizations to validate that security objectives align with business and regulatory requirements.

#
### Auditing and logging of changes
Auditing and logging track modifications to software, configurations, and environments, providing visibility into potential security issues and supporting accountability. Logs help detect unauthorized changes, analyze incidents, and verify compliance with policies.
Example: A version control system logs every commit, including author, timestamp, and modified files. Security teams review these logs to identify suspicious changes or unauthorized access attempts. Regular audits ensure developers follow secure coding practices.

#
### Risk analysis and mitigation
Risk analysis identifies potential threats, vulnerabilities, and their impact on software security. Mitigation involves applying controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of security incidents. Continuous assessment helps prioritize security efforts based on risk exposure.
Example: A web application undergoes a threat modeling exercise, identifying SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. Mitigation measures include input validation, parameterized queries, and security testing to verify that risks are effectively addressed.

#
### Key takeaway
Assessing software security effectiveness relies on continuous monitoring, auditing, and structured risk analysis. By tracking changes, logging events, and addressing identified risks, organizations can ensure that their software remains resilient against threats, compliant with standards, and aligned with business objectives.

#
### 8.4 Assess security impact of acquired software
### What it means
This topic focuses on evaluating the security risks associated with software or services acquired from external sources. Organizations rarely build everything in-house; they rely on third-party, commercial, or cloud solutions. Each type of acquired software introduces unique risks, including vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or compliance gaps. CISSP professionals must assess these risks before adoption and implement appropriate mitigation strategies.

#
### Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
COTS software is pre-packaged and widely available. While convenient, it may include undiscovered vulnerabilities, default configurations, or insufficient documentation. Organizations must assess licensing, patch management, and vendor support.

**Example:** Purchasing a widely-used accounting software requires verifying vendor patch cycles, reviewing known vulnerabilities, and restricting administrative access to reduce exposure.

#
### Open source
Open-source software is publicly available and can be modified. While cost-effective and flexible, risks include unvetted code contributions, inconsistent updates, and potential licensing issues. Security depends on active community support and internal review processes.

**Example:** Using an open-source library in a web application requires evaluating the project’s update frequency, monitoring vulnerability databases, and integrating the library into automated security testing pipelines.

#
### Third-party software
Software provided by external vendors or contractors may not follow the same security standards as the organization. Risks include weak authentication, hidden vulnerabilities, and insufficient support.

**Example:** A third-party CRM system needs security assessment to ensure it enforces strong password policies, encryption in transit and at rest, and audit logging.

#
### Managed services (e.g., enterprise applications)
Managed services are fully operated by external providers. Security impact assessment includes evaluating service-level agreements (SLAs), incident response capabilities, data segregation, and regulatory compliance.

**Example:** Adopting a managed HR platform requires reviewing SLAs for uptime, backup policies, and how data breaches are reported and handled by the vendor.

#
### Cloud services (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS)
Cloud services introduce shared responsibility models. Organizations must understand which security controls the provider manages versus those they are responsible for, including identity management, encryption, monitoring, and compliance obligations.

**Example:** Using a SaaS collaboration platform requires ensuring secure user provisioning, enforcing multi-factor authentication, monitoring access logs, and validating data residency requirements.

#
### Key takeaway
Acquired software and services carry inherent security risks. A thorough assessment evaluates the software type, vendor practices, update cycles, configuration requirements, and compliance with organizational policies. Effective controls, monitoring, and contractual agreements reduce the potential security impact, ensuring the software supports business objectives without introducing unacceptable risk.

#
### 8.5 Define and apply secure coding guidelines and standards
### What it means
This topic focuses on ensuring that software is written with security in mind, preventing vulnerabilities from being introduced at the source-code level. CISSP professionals should understand common coding weaknesses, how APIs can be exploited, and how secure coding standards and practices mitigate risks. Secure coding is the foundation of resilient software and reduces the need for costly post-deployment fixes.

#
### Security weaknesses and vulnerabilities at the source-code level
Vulnerabilities can arise from poor coding practices, inadequate input validation, buffer overflows, race conditions, improper error handling, and hardcoded secrets. Recognizing these weaknesses during development is crucial.

**Example:** A web application fails to sanitize user input, allowing SQL injection attacks. Mitigation includes input validation, parameterized queries, and secure error handling.

#
### Security of application programming interfaces (API)
APIs expose functionality to other software components or third-party systems. Unsecured APIs can be exploited to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, or execute unauthorized actions.

**Example:** An API lacks rate limiting and proper authentication, allowing attackers to perform brute-force attacks on user accounts. Mitigation: enforce strong authentication, token-based access, rate limiting, and input validation.

#
### Secure coding practices
These are development techniques aimed at preventing vulnerabilities. Practices include:

- Input validation and output encoding
- Proper error and exception handling
- Principle of least privilege in code execution
- Avoiding hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Using secure libraries and frameworks
- Regular code reviews and static/dynamic code analysis

**Example:** Developers use prepared statements instead of string concatenation to prevent SQL injection, and conduct peer code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment.

#
### Software-defined security
Security is integrated programmatically into applications, platforms, and networks. Policies, controls, and monitoring are defined in code rather than applied manually. This enables automated enforcement and rapid response to threats.

**Example:** An organization implements software-defined network segmentation in the application layer, dynamically enforcing access controls based on user roles, location, and device trust level.

#
### Key takeaway
Secure coding standards are essential for preventing vulnerabilities at the source level, protecting APIs, and embedding security into software design. By following secure coding practices, performing code reviews, and leveraging software-defined security, organizations reduce the risk of exploitation, ensure compliance, and build resilient applications. Security must be proactive, consistent, and integrated into every stage of software development.
