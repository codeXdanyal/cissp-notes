### 2.1 Identify and Classify Information and Assets

### What It Means:
Not all data or assets are equally valuable. Some are sensitive and must be heavily protected, while others are less critical. Classification helps an organization decide how much protection to apply. Think of it like labeling valuables at home—your passport gets locked in a safe, while old magazines stay on the coffee table.

### Data Classification:
This is about labeling data based on its sensitivity and importance to the organization. The goal is to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access while ensuring less critical data is still accessible when needed.

Common levels of data classification (names can vary by organization):

- **Public:** Safe to share openly (e.g., company brochures).
- **Internal Use Only**: Meant for employees but not outsiders (e.g., staff memos).
- **Confidential**: Sensitive information requiring limited access (e.g., financial reports).
- **Restricted/Highly Confidential**: Extremely sensitive, highest protection needed (e.g., trade secrets, customer PII).

<mark>**Examples:**</mark>  
A hospital might classify patient records as Highly Confidential, while cafeteria menus are Public.

### Asset Classification:
Assets are not only data but also physical and digital resources (servers, laptops, applications, even people with critical knowledge). Asset classification ensures these resources are prioritized and protected.

Categories can include:

- **Hardware Assets:** Computers, servers, networking devices.
- **Software Assets**: Applications, operating systems, licenses.
- **Information Assets**: Databases, documents, intellectual property.
- **People Assets**: Employees with specialized knowledge or access.

<mark>**Examples:**</mark> 
An organization may classify its data center as a critical asset needing multiple security layers (locks, surveillance, fire suppression), while an office printer is a low-value asset with minimal protections.

### Key Takeaway:
By classifying data and assets, organizations know where to focus their security efforts. Sensitive or critical items get more protection, while less important ones don’t waste resources. This ensures the right balance between security, usability, and cost.

### 2.2 Establish Information and Asset Handling Requirements

### What It Means:
Once data and assets are classified (from 2.1), the next step is to define how they should be handled at every stage of their lifecycle—storage, use, transfer, and disposal. Handling requirements ensure sensitive assets are always treated with the right level of protection.

### Information Handling:
Handling requirements depend on the classification level of the data. The higher the sensitivity, the stricter the controls.

**Examples:**

- Public Data: Can be shared openly, no special requirements.
- Internal Use: Stored on company systems, shared only within the organization.
- Confidential: Encrypted when stored or sent, limited access with authentication.
- Highly Confidential/Restricted: Strict access control, encryption, logging of all access, physical security if printed.

<mark>**Examples:**</mark>  
A financial report marked “Confidential” must be encrypted before emailing, while a press release (Public) can go on the company website.

### Asset Handling:
Assets (like hardware, software, and devices) also need handling rules.

**Examples:**

- Hardware Assets: Securely stored in controlled areas; laptops must be locked when unattended.
- Software Assets: Use licensed copies only, patch regularly, and control installations.
- Information Assets: Protect with backups, encryption, and access restrictions.
- People Assets: Train employees on security policies and limit their access to what they need (principle of least privilege).

<mark>**Examples:**</mark>  
If an employee leaves the company, their laptop must be collected, wiped, and reissued properly, not just left in storage.

### Special Handling Situations:

**1.** **Storage:** Use encryption, backups, and secure physical locations.

**2.** **Transmission/Transfer:** Encrypt emails, use secure file transfer protocols, or hand-carry in sealed containers if physical.

**3.** **Printing/Copying:** Limit physical copies of sensitive information; use secure printers requiring user authentication.

**4.** **Disposal/Destruction:** Shred paper documents; wipe or physically destroy hard drives and other storage media.

<mark>**Examples:**</mark>  
Throwing old hard drives in the trash could expose confidential data. Secure disposal ensures no one can recover it.

### Key Takeaway:
Handling requirements are about treating each piece of data or asset according to its sensitivity. Public items need minimal control, while highly confidential ones demand strict measures like encryption, access logs, and secure destruction. This ensures information stays protected throughout its entire lifecycle.
