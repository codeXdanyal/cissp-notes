# Domain 1 Summary: Security & Risk Management

## Overview
Domain 1 focuses on the foundational concepts of security, risk, governance, and compliance. It teaches how to protect information, manage risks, follow laws and ethics, and ensure that security supports the organization’s goals.

## Key Points

### Professional Ethics
- Act honestly, responsibly, and fairly.
- Follow the ISC² Code of Ethics and your organization’s policies.
- Encourage others to do the same to build trust and credibility.

### Security Concepts (5 Pillars)
- **Confidentiality:** Keep information private.
- **Integrity:** Ensure information is accurate and trustworthy.
- **Availability:** Make sure systems and data are accessible when needed.
- **Authenticity:** Verify identities and sources.
- **Nonrepudiation:** Ensure actions cannot be denied later.

### Security Governance
- Align security with business goals.
- Define clear roles, responsibilities, and processes.
- Apply frameworks like ISO, NIST, COBIT, SABSA, PCI.
- Practice due care (reasonable protection) and due diligence (ongoing review).

### Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Issues
- Understand cybercrimes, licensing, import/export controls, transborder data flow, privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, POPIA), and contractual/regulatory requirements to protect the organization legally.

### Investigation Types
- Know the difference between administrative, criminal, civil, regulatory, and industry investigations.
- Follow proper procedures for evidence collection and reporting.

### Policies, Standards, Procedures, and Guidelines
- **Policies:** High-level rules (“what and why”).
- **Standards:** Mandatory technical rules (“exactly what”).
- **Procedures:** Step-by-step instructions (“how to”).
- **Guidelines:** Recommended practices (“advice for flexibility”).
- Implement, document, and communicate them effectively.

### Business Continuity (BC)
- Perform Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to identify critical functions.
- Assess external dependencies and implement strategies to keep operations running during disruptions.

### Personnel Security
- Screen candidates, enforce employment agreements.
- Manage onboarding, transfers, terminations.
- Control vendor/contractor access to reduce insider threats.

### Risk Management
- Identify threats and vulnerabilities.
- Analyze and assess risks.
- Respond with preventive, detective, or corrective controls.
- Use frameworks (ISO, NIST, COBIT, SABSA, PCI).
- Continuously monitor, report, and improve processes.

### Threat Modeling
- Anticipate attacks using methodologies like STRIDE, PASTA, and OCTAVE.
- Identify assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies to strengthen security proactively.

### Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)
- Manage risks from suppliers and third-party products.
- Mitigate risks with third-party assessments, security requirements, SLAs, hardware trust (Silicon Root of Trust, PUF), and software transparency (SBOM).

### Security Awareness, Education, and Training
- Educate employees to recognize threats like phishing and social engineering.
- Use methods such as security champions, gamification, and periodic updates for emerging technologies.
- Measure effectiveness to improve awareness and behavior.

## Big Picture Takeaway
Domain 1 emphasizes that security is not just about technology—it’s about people, processes, policies, and governance. Ethics, risk management, compliance, business continuity, and awareness together create a strong foundation for protecting an organization’s information and supporting its goals.
