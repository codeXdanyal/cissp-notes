# Domain 1: Security and Risk Management

## 1.1 Understand, Adhere to, and Promote Professional Ethics

### What It Means:

Professional ethics are like a set of rules or a moral compass for anyone working in cybersecurity. They guide how you behave, what decisions you make, and how you interact with colleagues, clients, and the public. Following ethics is not just about avoiding trouble—it builds trust and credibility, which is crucial in security work.

### [ISC² Code of Professional Ethics](https://www.isc2.org/ethics)

ISC² (the organization behind CISSP) has its own **Code of Ethics**. Think of it as the “gold standard” for cybersecurity professionals worldwide. The main idea is that you must act honestly, treat others fairly, and prioritize the security and well-being of people and organizations.

<mark>**Example:**</mark> If you find a serious security flaw in your company’s system, the ethical approach is to report it responsibly rather than exploiting it for personal gain.

### Organizational Code of Ethics

Many companies also have their own **internal ethics policies**. These can include rules on confidentiality, data handling, workplace behavior, and reporting incidents. Adhering to these ensures you are aligned with your employer’s expectations while maintaining professional integrity.

<mark>**Example:**</mark> Your company may have a policy that prohibits sharing internal client data. Even if you are trusted, following this rule is part of professional ethics.

### Promoting Ethics

Being ethical isn’t just about following rules yourself; it’s also about encouraging your team or peers to do the same. This can involve mentoring, sharing ethical guidelines, and setting a good example. Organizations with strong ethical cultures tend to have fewer security breaches caused by insider mistakes.

<mark>**Example:**</mark> If a teammate is tempted to take shortcuts that risk security, you could remind them of the ethical standards and suggest a safer approach.

### Key Takeaway

Ethics is the foundation of trust in cybersecurity. Knowing both the **ISC² Code of Ethics** and your **organization’s policies**, following them consistently, and encouraging others to do the same is just as important as technical skills.

## 1.2 Understand and Apply Security Concepts

### What It Means:

Security concepts are the basic principles that guide how we protect information. They form the foundation for all security practices. Understanding these concepts helps you make decisions that reduce risks, protect data, and ensure systems are trustworthy.

**5 Pillars of Information Security:**

1. **Confidentiality:**  
   Confidentiality ensures that information is only accessible to those who are authorized. It’s about keeping secrets safe.

     <mark>**Example:**</mark> Your company’s customer database should only be accessed by people who need it, not by anyone who walks by. Using passwords and encryption helps maintain confidentiality.

2. **Integrity:**  
   Integrity means information is accurate and hasn’t been altered by unauthorized people. It ensures the data you receive or store is trustworthy.

    <mark>**Example:**</mark> If a bank transaction record shows $500, it shouldn’t suddenly change to $5,000 because of an error or attack. Checksums, hashes, and version control help maintain integrity.

3. **Availability:**  
   Availability ensures that information and systems are accessible when needed. A system isn’t secure if it’s protected but constantly offline.

    <mark>**Example:**</mark> An e-commerce website must be online and functional during business hours. Redundant servers or cloud backups improve availability.

5. **Authenticity:**  
   Authenticity verifies that data, communications, or users are genuine and come from trusted sources.

    <mark>**Example:**</mark> When you receive an email from your manager, authenticity ensures it really came from them and not a hacker pretending to be your manager. Digital signatures and certificates help confirm authenticity.

5. **Nonrepudiation:**  
   Nonrepudiation ensures that someone cannot deny an action they performed. It provides proof of involvement in a transaction or communication.

    <mark>**Example:**</mark> If a person signs an online contract, nonrepudiation prevents them from claiming later that they never agreed. Digital signatures and audit logs support nonrepudiation.

### Key Takeaway:

The 5 pillars—Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, and Nonrepudiation—are the core principles that guide security decisions. Together, they help ensure information is protected, trustworthy, and reliably accessible

## 1.3 Evaluate and Apply Security Governance Principles

### What It Means:

Security governance is about making sure that an organization’s security efforts support its overall business goals. It’s not just about technology—it’s about policies, processes, and people working together to reduce risk and achieve the organization’s mission safely and effectively.

### Alignment to Business Strategy:

The security function should always support the organization’s mission, goals, and objectives. Security decisions should make business sense, not just technical sense.

<mark>**Example:**</mark> If a company’s goal is to expand into e-commerce, security must ensure online transactions are protected without slowing down the customer experience.

### Organizational Processes:

Security needs to be part of all major organizational processes, including acquisitions, divestitures, or mergers. Governance committees often oversee security strategy to make sure risks are managed consistently.

<mark>**Example:**</mark> When a company acquires another firm, security teams evaluate risks in the acquired systems and data to prevent breaches.

### Organizational Roles and Responsibilities:

Everyone in an organization has a role in security, from executives to staff. Clear roles and responsibilities prevent confusion and ensure accountability.

<mark>**Example:**</mark> The CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) oversees overall security strategy, while system admins implement technical controls, and employees follow security policies in daily tasks.

### Security Control Frameworks:

Frameworks provide structured guidelines to implement and measure security. Popular frameworks include:

- **ISO/IEC 27001:** International standard for managing informationsecurity.
- **NIST:** U.S. guidelines for cybersecurity controls.
- **COBIT:** Focuses on IT governance.
- **SABSA:** Security architecture framework.
- **PCI DSS:** For protecting payment card data.
- **FedRAMP:** For cloud security compliance in U.S. federal agencies.

<mark>**Example:**</mark> Using ISO 27001, an organization can systematically identify risks and apply controls to protect sensitive data.

### Due Care / Due Diligence:

Due care is about taking reasonable steps to protect assets, while due diligence is about continually assessing and verifying that protections are effective.

<mark>**Example:**</mark> Due care would be implementing strong firewalls and encryption. Due diligence would be regularly reviewing logs and testing security controls to ensure they work.

### Key Takeaway:

Security governance ensures that security is not an afterthought but a strategic part of business operations. By aligning security with business goals, defining roles, applying frameworks, and practicing due care and due diligence, organizations can reduce risk and operate securely.
