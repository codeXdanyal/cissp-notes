# Domain 1: Security and Risk Management

## 1.1 Understand, Adhere to, and Promote Professional Ethics

### What It Means:
Professional ethics are like a set of rules or a moral compass for anyone working in cybersecurity. They guide how you behave, what decisions you make, and how you interact with colleagues, clients, and the public. Following ethics is not just about avoiding trouble—it builds trust and credibility, which is crucial in security work.

### [ISC² Code of Professional Ethics](https://www.isc2.org/ethics)
ISC² (the organization behind CISSP) has its own **Code of Ethics**. Think of it as the “gold standard” for cybersecurity professionals worldwide. The main idea is that you must act honestly, treat others fairly, and prioritize the security and well-being of people and organizations.  
**Example:** If you find a serious security flaw in your company’s system, the ethical approach is to report it responsibly rather than exploiting it for personal gain.

### Organizational Code of Ethics 
Many companies also have their own **internal ethics policies**. These can include rules on confidentiality, data handling, workplace behavior, and reporting incidents. Adhering to these ensures you are aligned with your employer’s expectations while maintaining professional integrity.

### Promoting Ethics 
Being ethical isn’t just about following rules yourself; it’s also about encouraging your team or peers to do the same. This can involve mentoring, sharing ethical guidelines, and setting a good example. Organizations with strong ethical cultures tend to have fewer security breaches caused by insider mistakes.  
**Example:** If a teammate is tempted to take shortcuts that risk security, you could remind them of the ethical standards and suggest a safer approach.

### Key Takeaway 
Ethics is the foundation of trust in cybersecurity. Knowing both the **ISC² Code of Ethics** and your **organization’s policies**, following them consistently, and encouraging others to do the same is just as important as technical skills.
