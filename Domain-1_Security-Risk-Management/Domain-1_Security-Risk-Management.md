# Domain 1: Security and Risk Management

# 1.1 Understand, adhere to, and promote professional ethics

Professional ethics are rules that guide cybersecurity professionals to act responsibly and honestly. They ensure trust, integrity, and accountability in the work environment.

### 1) ISC² Code of Professional Ethics
- A global standard for CISSP-certified professionals.
- Instructs you to act with integrity, respect confidentiality, protect information, and comply with laws.

### 2) Organizational Code of Ethics
- Each company may have its own set of ethics, like policies on confidentiality, acceptable use of resources, and reporting security issues.

### Example
- **ISC² Ethics:** Discovering a vulnerability in a client’s system means you report it, rather than exploiting it.
- **Organizational Ethics:** Company policy may require encrypting sensitive data before storing it on shared drives.

### Tip/Important Point
Follow both ISC² ethics and your organization’s code. Ethics protect you, your employer, and the data you manage.

# 1.2 Understand and apply security concepts

Security concepts are the basic ideas that protect information from being stolen, changed, or lost. The five pillars of information security are:

### 1) Confidentiality
- Keeping information secret so only authorized people can access it.

### 2) Integrity
- Making sure information is accurate and not tampered with.

### 3) Availability
- Ensuring information is accessible when needed.

### 4) Authenticity
- Verifying that data, users, or systems are genuine.

### 5) Non-repudiation
- Ensuring that someone cannot deny sending or receiving information.

### Example
- **Confidentiality:** Using a password to protect your email account.
- **Integrity:** Using a checksum to verify that a downloaded file hasn’t been altered.
- **Availability:** Cloud backups ensure your files are available even if your computer crashes.
- **Authenticity:** Digital certificates verify a website is legitimate before you enter your card details.
- **Non-repudiation:** Email services keep logs so the sender cannot deny sending an important contract.

### Tip/Important Point
Think of the five pillars as a security checklist: Protect information from the wrong people, keep it correct, make it available, verify it, and ensure actions can’t be denied.
